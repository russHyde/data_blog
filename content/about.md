This is my research blog about data science. Anything interesting from
computing, data analysis, maths or biology may make it into here. I
am in the process of migrating some content from blogger - most of my early
posts were about `R`, bioinformatics or the `bash` / `conda` / linux backdrop
to my daily work.

The site was made from Rmarkdown posts using the `R` package `blogdown` and
the static site engine `Hugo`.

All views my own.
