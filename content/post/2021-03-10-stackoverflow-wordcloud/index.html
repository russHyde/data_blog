<p><strong>Who answers what on Stack Overflow?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a little <a href="https://russ-hyde.shinyapps.io/stackover-wordcloud/">Shiny App</a>
I made that takes a Stack-Overflow User ID, finds out what subjects (tags) they
answer about on Stack Overflow, and creates a wordcloud of their most frequent
tags.</p>
<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/russHyde/stackover-wordcloud">here</a>.</p>
<p>It uses</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/stackr">stackr</a> package for accessing the Stack Exchange API;</li>
<li>and the CRAN package
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud/index.html">wordcloud</a> for drawing the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>The default image is my own wordcloud, and given the dominance of ‘r’, ‘python’,
‘snakemake’ and ‘conda’ reflects my data analysis / bioinformatics life.</p>
<p>I suspect it would be a very different image if the word sizes were proportional
to a ratio of my answer count and the global answer count for each tag, since
for example, I probably answer far more niche lintr questions than the average
user.</p>
