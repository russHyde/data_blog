**You've been analysing data all day, now let's analyse your code ...**

Within it's programming toolkit, _R_ has some really cool things for analysing
code and for identifying / fixing issues in your code.

What kinds of code-level stuff do these tools make you aware of?

- Dependencies

    - between packages (`pkgnet`)

    - between functions within a package or script (`pkgnet` / `CodeDepends`)

- Complexity

    - `cyclocomp`

- Style

    - Code formatting (`lintr` / `styler` / `formatR`)

    - Alternative (safer / more idiomatic) language constructs

- Test quality

    - Are all your functions tested? (`covr`)
    
    - Are your tests good enough? (See `mutate` / `hedgehog`)

- Performance

    - `microbenchmark`, `profvis` etc

- Documentation / Installability / Loadability

    - `R CMD check` / `goodpractice` (TLDR: for packages at least, running
    `R CMD check` and `goodpractice` should be essential)

Code analysis splits neatly into two camps,
[dynamic-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis) and
[static-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis),
loosely depending on whether your code is ran during the analysis. For example,
you could determine whether all the variable names in a script conform to some
style guide without having to run that script (static); but you'd need to run
the script to work out which function calls have the largest appetite for
processor time or memory (dynamic).

Here, I'm more interested in code correctness, design and style than speed or
RAM usage.

## Notes

Prospective packages:

- `mutate` from rOpenSci

- `dupree` from me

Things that can be done in other languages that aren't (yet? / to my knowledge)
available or possible in R:

- type-checking

- unused code detection

- refactoring recommendations (? this is done by goodpractice)

- security problems

But there's no real substitute for getting a human to code-review your stuff,
because there isn't any automated way to address the most important thing:

- code readability

[blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/) that covers some
tools that help during package development.
