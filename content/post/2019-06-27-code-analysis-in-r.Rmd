**You've been analysing data all day, now let's analyse your code ...**

Within it's programming toolkit, _R_ has some really cool things for analysing
code and for identifying / fixing issues in your code.

What kinds of code-level stuff do these tools make you aware of?

- Dependencies

    - between packages (`pkgnet`)

    - between functions within a package or script (`pkgnet` / `CodeDepends`)

- Complexity

    - Labyrinthine functions (`cyclocomp`)

    - Function length etc

- Style

    - Code formatting (`lintr` / `styler` / `formatR`)

    - Refactorings: alternative (eg, safer / more idiomatic) language
    constructs with similar behaviour (`goodpractice` does a bit of this; but
    _R_ doesn't have much refactoring support)

- Test quality

    - Are all your functions tested? (`covr`)

    - Are your tests good enough? (See `mutate` / `hedgehog`)

- Performance

    - `microbenchmark`, `profvis` etc

- Documentation / Installability / Loadability

    - `R CMD check` / `goodpractice` (for packages at least, running
    `R CMD check` and `goodpractice` should be essential)

... and being aware of these things can help you restructure your code, so that
it's more easily used, maintained and extended.

Code analysis splits neatly into two camps,
[dynamic-](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis) and
[static-analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis),
loosely depending on whether your code is ran during the analysis. For example,
you could determine whether all the variable names in a script conform to some
style guide without having to run that script (static); but you'd need to run
a script to work out which function calls have the largest appetite for
processor time or memory (dynamic).






## Notes

Here, I'm more interested in code correctness, design and style than speed or
RAM usage.

Prospective packages:

- `mutate` from rOpenSci

- `dupree` from me

Things that can be done in other languages that aren't (yet? / to my knowledge)
available or possible in R:

- type-checking

- unused code detection

- refactoring recommendations (? this is done by goodpractice)

- security problems

But there's no real substitute for getting a human to code-review your stuff,
because there isn't any automated way to address the most important thing:

- code readability

"Nice R Code" has a
[blog post](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-05-07-how-long-is-a-function/)
on function lengths in R packages and also a post about why nice code is
[something to strive for](https://nicercode.github.io/blog/2013-04-05-why-nice-code/)

Maelle Salmon from rOpenSci has a nice
[blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/) that covers some
tools that help during package development.

Some code smells that are particularly relevant here pave the many rings of 
[the _R_ inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
