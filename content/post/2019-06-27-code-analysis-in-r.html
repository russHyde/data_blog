<p><strong>You’ve been analysing data all day, now let’s analyse your code …</strong></p>
<p>Within it’s programming toolkit, <em>R</em> has some really cool things for analysing
code and for identifying / fixing issues in your code.</p>
<p>What kinds of code-level stuff (eg, software-design/architectural properties,
code smells) might you want to be aware of when developing packages or writing
analysis scripts? And what tools are available to do this?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dependencies</p>
<ul>
<li><p>between packages (<code>pkgnet</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>between functions within a package or script (<code>pkgnet</code> / <code>CodeDepends</code>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Complexity</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Labyrinthine functions (<code>cyclocomp</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Elongated functions</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Style</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Code formatting (<code>lintr</code> / <code>styler</code> / <code>formatR</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactorings: alternative (eg, safer / more idiomatic) language
constructs with similar behaviour (<code>goodpractice</code> does a bit of this; but
<em>R</em> doesn’t have much refactoring support)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Test quality</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Are all your functions tested? (<code>covr</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Are your tests good enough? (See <code>mutate</code> / <code>hedgehog</code>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Performance</p>
<ul>
<li><code>microbenchmark</code>, <code>profvis</code> etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Documentation / Installability / Loadability</p>
<ul>
<li><code>R CMD check</code> / <code>goodpractice</code> (for packages at least, running
<code>R CMD check</code> and <code>goodpractice</code> should be essential)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>… and being aware of these things can help you restructure your code, so that
it’s more easily used, maintained and extended.</p>
<p>Code analysis splits neatly into two camps,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis">dynamic-</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">static-analysis</a>,
loosely depending on whether your code is ran during the analysis. For example,
you could determine whether all the variable names in a script conform to some
style guide without having to run that script (static); but you’d need to run
a script to work out which function calls have the largest appetite for
processor time or memory (dynamic).</p>
<p>In the following posts, I’m going to explain how to use these tools (and a
couple of tools that are less well developed) on your analysis scripts or
packages.</p>
<p>In the face of these automatic code-analysis tools, it’s important to remember
that there’s no real substitute for getting a human to code-review your stuff,
because there isn’t any automated way to address the most important thing: code
readability.</p>
<!--
  For each of the tools, describe
  - The package & author
  - Any existing blog posts or vignettes that describe how to use it
  - The architectural property or code smell that the package can help you
  quantify or address and why addressing _that_ matters
  - A brief example of how to use it, either:
    - against a script
    - against a package
    - against a set of packages
  - Does the tool
    - directly modify your source code?
    - run your source code?
    - require tests to be in place before running?

## Notes

Here, I'm more interested in code correctness, design and style than speed or
RAM usage.

Prospective packages:

- `mutate` from rOpenSci

- `dupree` from me

Things that can be done in other languages that aren't (yet? / to my knowledge)
available or possible in R:

- type-checking

- unused code detection

- refactoring recommendations (? this is done by goodpractice)

- security problems
