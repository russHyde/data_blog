<p><strong>Get your reproducibility here!</strong></p>
<p>Reproducibility is nice. It’s nice to be able to rerun a project from a couple
of years ago and get the same results, reports and figures. It’s even nicer if
you can hand your project over to someone else, and they can generate the same
results.</p>
<p>But it takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>What could change in the intervening couple-of-years, or on transfer from one
computer to another, that would alter the results generated in a project?</p>
<ul>
<li>the raw data could get moved, relabelled, appended, or lost</li>
<li>the source code could change,</li>
<li>the code might not even be written with reproducibility in mind (eg, not
setting random seeds; not using versioned data-releases)</li>
<li>literally any part of the software could be updated, deprecated or otherwise
changed</li>
</ul>
<p>Environment management tools can help with the latter issue (as can containers,
of which I have less experience). Ideally, they allow you to store the details
of any packages / libraries that are used when running a given project in the
source-code for that project; then when you need to rerun the project, you can
use those exact same packages.</p>
<p>For the past few years, I have used
<a href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html"><code>conda</code></a>
environments to handle all my research projects (which were mostly
bioinformatics / genomics).</p>
<p>The great thing about conda is it’s language independence: you can specify
project-dependencies from several worlds, be they python, R, command-line tools.
It also simplifies installing packages, like numpy, that would otherwise involve
installing a lot of low-level libraries. And it’s a well established project.
There’s no point placing your reproducibility requirements in the hands of a
tool that might not exist in two years time.</p>
<p>Speaking from my (R-biased) viewpoint, conda has posed some problems as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There have been several times when I could no longer build a conda-environment
from a previously valid specification. This is typically due to broken packages
being removed from
<a href="https://anaconda.org/">anaconda.org</a> (the database that conda uses when
installing packages).</p></li>
<li><p>Installing packages is a non-native experience. R user’s are used to using <code>install.packages("somePackage")</code> to install packages from CRAN (this already
handles the installation dependencies of ‘somePackage’). But to add this to a
conda environment you would use <code>conda install r-somepackage</code> at the command
line.</p></li>
<li><p>Installing non-conda packages</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing a non-conda-package (eg, using <code>remotes::install_github</code>) can be
done. But, if that package depends on anything else that isn’t yet in your
conda env, try and make sure the other packages are installed using
<code>conda install</code>.</li>
<li>If the required package is available through CRAN, it’s better to make a
conda skeleton for that package and install that through conda from your
personal anaconda account (details
<a href="http://biolearnr.blogspot.com/2018/01/pushing-r-eulerr-onto-anaconda-using.html">here</a>).</li>
<li>Where I developed local packages for use within an analysis project, they
were installed into the conda env using
<code>R CMD INSTALL -l &lt;conda-path&gt; &lt;my-package.tar&gt;</code> as part of a
<a href="https://github.com/russHyde/data_buddy">project-setup script</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Multiple channels. For each package you might want to install, there are
multiple versions available, but also there are multiple ’channel’s from which
the package could be obtained. For example, most bioinformatics-specific
packages are found in the <a href="https://bioconda.github.io/">‘bioconda’ channel</a>.
For more general R packages, there is the
<a href="https://anaconda.org/r">‘r’ channel</a>, and also the
<a href="https://anaconda.org/conda-forge">‘conda-forge’ channel</a>. I always install
things from conda-forge whenever there is a choice (it plays nicer with
bioconda, and, though this isn’t a problem anymore, won’t compel you to use
MRO)</p></li>
<li><p>Solving environments can take ages. This has been a major pain over the years.
Before it can install a package, conda has to ensure that a version of the
package (and any dependencies) can be found that will install alongside your
current environment (or find a way to modify your current environment so that
the package can be installed). Since there’s lots of channels and lots of
versions of each package this can take a long time. And, if your environment
gets too big (a mistake I’ve made many times), it may be impossible to find
an installation recipe that is compatible with your environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Dev environment == Analysis environment. This is more of an R issue than a
conda issue (since I don’t think ‘renv’ solves it either). It would be nice to
be able to have two related environments for a given project: one within which
the analyses run, and an expanded version of the analysis-env within which to
write &amp; test code. Each extra package you add to a working environment
increases the chances that environment may break in the future. Though you
might want rstudio, devtools, testthat et al in the environment where you
write code, you shouldn’t need to include those in the environment where your
analyses run.</p></li>
<li><p>IDE support. There are two ways to use rstudio alongside conda environments.
You either install rstudio system-wide, or you install it as part of a conda
environment. If you do the latter, you will be restricted to using an older
version of R and Rstudio (v1.1.456 as of Feb 2021). So, please, don’t! You
only need a handful of R packages installed for rstudio to work (minimally),
but if you install rstudio via conda it will add dozens of dependencies to
your environment. If on linux, you’re better to activate an environment that
contains r-base and r-rstudioapi (and a few other libraries) and install
rstudio from the command line. Then, start rstudio from the command line and
it will work using whichever R is present in the activated environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, try to avoid environment bloat and you’ll be happy.</p>
<div id="renv" class="section level2">
<h2>renv</h2>
<p><a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">{renv}</a> (and it’s
predecessor {packrat}) is an R-specific environment management tool. To use it
in a new project you run the following:</p>
<pre><code>renv::init()</code></pre>
<p>That will start a blank environment (only containing the base R packages, like
<code>stats</code> and <code>graphics</code>) based upon the R release that you are using. Then any
time you need to install an R package for use in your project, call
<code>install.packages()</code> or <code>install_github()</code>. The packages will be installed into
(or linked from) a project-specific package directory. Then you can call</p>
<pre><code>renv::snapshot()</code></pre>
<p>and it will store the details of all the packages that your project is using, in
such a way that you could load up that project on another computer and easily
generate the same environment (to do this call <code>renv::restore()</code>).</p>
<p>For this blog, I have
- a minimal conda environment that contains <code>r-base</code>, <code>r-renv</code> and
<code>r-rstudioapi</code>;
- rstudio installed system-wide;
- and an renv-defined environment that manages all the R packages used while
writing (blogdown etc).</p>
<p>And, oh joy, I can install packages in seconds again!</p>
