<p>Data analysis projects need a slightly different structure from general
programming projects <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Their organisation should ensure they are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reproducible</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the project should be rerunnable and all results / reports generated
should be automatically produced</p></li>
<li><p>running it on a different computer or in a different location should not
affect the results</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>version-controlled</p>
<ul>
<li>an explicit version of the source code, and any dependencies (eg,
external github repos, CRAN packages, command line tools) should be used</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>consistent</p>
<ul>
<li>the structure of one project should look like another</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>quick</p>
<ul>
<li><p>initialising a new project should be quick</p></li>
<li><p>running a project should require only a few commands</p></li>
<li><p>you shouldn’t have to run the whole project whenever a small part of it
is changed</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>nestable</p>
<ul>
<li>in a large project it may make sense to define subjobs within
subdirectories</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>modular</p>
<ul>
<li>a sensible way to share code / data between multiple projects</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>language / toolkit / hardware agnostic</p>
<ul>
<li>it should be possible to use python, bash, R, SQL etc all within one
project without having to monkey with the project structure too much</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>chop-and-changeable</p>
<ul>
<li><p>you like ruffus (github|hg|venv), I like snakemake (bitbucket|git|conda)</p></li>
<li><p>I once liked jupyter, I now like R-Markdown - this stuff shouldn’t be
fixed at initialisation, a project should permit migration from one set-up
to another</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few project-organisation tools out there but they’re frequently
tied to a single language or to a type of data-analysis that doesn’t fit my
(bioinformatics) everyday life.</p>
<p>The life-cycle for a data analysis project is supposed to look something like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Question -&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Data acquisition / preparation -&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Exploration / Modelling -&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Communication -&gt;</p></li>
<li><p>Further questions …</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some projects are more fruitful than others, and may mean that your approaches
and tools need to be scaled up for use by other people or on other datasets.
So, the life-cycle includes maintenance, implementation etc in some settings.</p>
<p>What this life-cycle view doesn’t show is that data, code and various other
tools / knowledge developed during one project are frequently of use in
parallel or subsequent projects. Really we’ve all got loads of life-cycles all
turning at the same time and good (code-level) project management can help
them all turn more frequently.</p>
